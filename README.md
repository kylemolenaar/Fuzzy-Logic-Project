In this repository are two notebook file and the dataset file.
In the feature selection file the features are selected and the plots are explanatory to the decisions we made.
In the main file the fuzzy model is created and there is a widget in which the user can identify the price of the car depending on the inputs of the features. These values can be adjusted to the user's wishes to recieve the price of the car with the features given.
This widget can be found in the second to last cell of the main file.
